# KEYWORD-SEARCHING-SYSTEM
Developing an interactive system that can search a text file looking for keywords, keep statistics on the results of the search, and print out these statistics.
Any word (except verb, adjective, preposition etc.) that appears multiple times (more than twice) in the text can be considered a
keyword. Read all the keywords from a file, build a minimal perfect hash table, and then start
reading the contents of a second text file and look for these keywords. Your system may
update the keyword list if it detects a few new keywords in the second file.
